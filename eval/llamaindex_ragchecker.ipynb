This commitment will\\nbe enough for engineer leaders or anyone not interested in the coding portion\\nof the program.\\n\\nThose interested in implementing the concepts discussed in class should set\\naside 2 to 4 hours weekly to complete the code walkthroughs and work on the\\nassignments.\\n\\n### Are live sessions recorded?\\n\\nYes, we record every live session. You can decide when to attend classes live\\nor catch up asynchronously later using the recording.\\n\\n### I\\'m a complete beginner. Is this program helpful for me?\\n\\nThis program is not an introduction to machine learning.\\n\\nWhile we\\'ll discuss many fundamental ideas behind machine learning, beginners\\nwill find the sessions go much faster than what\\'s optimal for them.\\n\\n### What does \"lifetime access\" mean?\\n\\nYou only pay once to join the program and get immediate access to every past,\\npresent, and future cohort.\\n\\nEvery new iteration of the program is better than the ones before. Many\\nstudents take classes once and then join a later cohort to benefit from the\\nupdates.\\n\\nThe lifetime access removes any pressure from having to complete the program\\nwhen life gets in the way.\\n\\n![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fheadshot.8b69bb12.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\n# Hey!

I love to make them work at scale.\\n\\nFrom 2009 to 2023, I built products for Disney, Boston Dynamics, IBM, Dell,\\nG4S, Anheuser-Busch, and NextEra Energy, among other clients. I learned about\\ntrade-offs and how to create products that work.\\n\\nI started this program in March 2023.

This commitment will\\nbe enough for engineer leaders or anyone not interested in the coding portion\\nof the program.\\n\\nThose interested in implementing the concepts discussed in class should set\\naside 2 to 4 hours weekly to complete the code walkthroughs and work on the\\nassignments.\\n\\n### Are live sessions recorded?\\n\\nYes, we record every live session. You can decide when to attend classes live\\nor catch up asynchronously later using the recording.\\n\\n### I\\'m a complete beginner. Is this program helpful for me?\\n\\nThis program is not an introduction to machine learning.\\n\\nWhile we\\'ll discuss many fundamental ideas behind machine learning, beginners\\nwill find the sessions go much faster than what\\'s optimal for them.\\n\\n### What does \"lifetime access\" mean?\\n\\nYou only pay once to join the program and get immediate access to every past,\\npresent, and future cohort.\\n\\nEvery new iteration of the program is better than the ones before. Many\\nstudents take classes once and then join a later cohort to benefit from the\\nupdates.\\n\\nThe lifetime access removes any pressure from having to complete the program\\nwhen life gets in the way.\\n\\n![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fheadshot.8b69bb12.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\n# Hey!
