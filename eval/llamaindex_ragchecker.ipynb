Worth every cent.\"\\n\\n**Jose Reyes** , AI/ML at Cevo Australia\\n\\n# Building Machine Learning Systems That Don\\'t Suck\\n\\nA **live, interactive program** that\\'ll help you build **production-ready**\\nmachine learning systems from the ground up.\\n\\nNext cohort: November 4 \\\\- 21, 2024\\n\\nCheck the schedule for more details about upcoming cohorts.\\n\\nI want to join!Sign in\\n\\n## Learn how to **design** , **build** , **deploy** , and **scale** machine\\nlearning systems to solve real-world problems.\\n\\nI\\'ll lose my mind if I see another book or course teaching people the same\\nbasic ideas for the hundredth time. Most people are stuck in beginner mode,\\nand finding help to solve real-world problems is hard.\\n\\nI want to change that.\\n\\nI started writing software 30 years ago. I\\'ve written pipelines and trained\\nmodels for some of the largest companies in the world. I want to show you how\\nto do the same.\\n\\nThis is the class I wish I had taken when I started.\\n\\nThis program will help you unlearn what you think machine learning is. It\\'s a\\npractical, hands-on class where you\\'ll learn from years of experience and\\nreal-world examples.\\n\\nWhen you join, you get **lifetime access** to the following:\\n\\n  * 18 hours of live, interactive sessions. We\\'ll use this time to discuss the first principles behind building machine learning systems.\\n  * 10 hours of step-by-step coding instructions. These practical sessions will show you how to build an end-to-end system from scratch.\\n  * A final project where you\\'ll build a complete solution and receive direct feedback on your work.\\n  * 100 coding assignments and practice questions.\\n  * The entire source code of a working production system. It\\'s yours. You can change and use it as you see fit.\\n  * A private community where you\\'ll collaborate with thousands of people from different backgrounds.\\n  * Direct access to your instructor.\\n  * Lifetime access to every past and future cohort.\\n  * Program certificate upon completion.\\n\\nAnd the best part is that you only pay once to join. There are no monthly\\nfees. No annual fees. No hidden costs. You pay once to join and benefit\\nforever until the end of time.\\n\\nThe program won\\'t be easy. It\\'ll take time and effort. But if you want to use\\nmachine learning to solve real-world problems, **this is the class you don \\'t\\nwant to miss.**\\n\\n# Who Is This Program For?\\n\\n## This is a practical, hands-on program for technical professionals who are\\nready to put in the work.\\n\\nThis program is for **software engineers** , **data scientists** , **data\\nanalysts** , **machine learning engineers** , **technical managers** , and\\nanyone anyone who wants to use machine learning to solve real-world problems.\\n\\nHere are the criteria to succeed in the program:\\n\\n  * You have experience writing code. We\\'ll use Python throughout the class, but you won\\'t have any problems if you know any other language.\\n  * You are familiar with basic machine learning terminology. This is not an introductory class. We\\'ll move quickly over the basics to focus on the fundamental ideas that make systems work.\\n  * You are ready to put in the work to succeed.\\n\\n> \"I have learned a ton from Santiago in his class and it was actually what\\n> helped inspire me and get into the MLOps work that I\\'m doing now.

This program will show you some of the\\nthings I\\'ve learned from real-life examples I\\'ve built during more than 30\\nyears in the industry.\\n\\nCheck the program syllabus →\\n\\n  1. ![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fslides-thumbnail.270f2d17.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\n### Real-life examples and case studies\\n\\nLearn from practical experience building machine learning systems that work in\\nthe real world.\\n\\n  2. ![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fvideo-thumbnail.228cee07.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\n### Live, interactive sessions\\n\\nAsk questions and interact with the instructor and other students in real\\ntime.\\n\\n  3. ![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-thumbnail.96685995.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\n### Code walkthroughs\\n\\nStep by step coding instructions to help you build a production system from\\nscratch.\\n\\n# Upcoming Schedule\\n\\n## Every iteration of the program gives you 18 hours of hands-on, live\\ntraining spread over 3 weeks.\\n\\nHere are the upcoming cohorts:\\n\\n  * Cohort 16: **November 4 - November 21, 2024. **1:00 PM EST\\n\\nLive sessions will take place every Monday and Thursday at the same time.

This commitment will\\nbe enough for engineer leaders or anyone not interested in the coding portion\\nof the program.\\n\\nThose interested in implementing the concepts discussed in class should set\\naside 2 to 4 hours weekly to complete the code walkthroughs and work on the\\nassignments.\\n\\n### Are live sessions recorded?\\n\\nYes, we record every live session. You can decide when to attend classes live\\nor catch up asynchronously later using the recording.\\n\\n### I\\'m a complete beginner. Is this program helpful for me?\\n\\nThis program is not an introduction to machine learning.\\n\\nWhile we\\'ll discuss many fundamental ideas behind machine learning, beginners\\nwill find the sessions go much faster than what\\'s optimal for them.\\n\\n### What does \"lifetime access\" mean?\\n\\nYou only pay once to join the program and get immediate access to every past,\\npresent, and future cohort.\\n\\nEvery new iteration of the program is better than the ones before. Many\\nstudents take classes once and then join a later cohort to benefit from the\\nupdates.\\n\\nThe lifetime access removes any pressure from having to complete the program\\nwhen life gets in the way.\\n\\n![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fheadshot.8b69bb12.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\n# Hey! I\\'m Santiago.\\n\\n## I\\'m the instructor of the program.\\n\\nI\\'m a machine learning engineer with over two decades of experience building\\nand scaling enterprise software and machine learning systems.\\n\\nI love neural networks. I love to make them work at scale.\\n\\nFrom 2009 to 2023, I built products for Disney, Boston Dynamics, IBM, Dell,\\nG4S, Anheuser-Busch, and NextEra Energy, among other clients. I learned about\\ntrade-offs and how to create products that work.\\n\\nI started this program in March 2023. Since then, thousands of students have\\ngraduated, and I can\\'t wait to meet you in class.\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/svpino)[](https://linkedin.com/in/svpino)\\n\\nCopyright © 2024 Tideily LLC\\n\\nAll rights reserved.\\n\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')"
