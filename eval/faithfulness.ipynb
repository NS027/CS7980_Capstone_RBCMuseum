In 1625, constru ction\\nwas started on a citadel  and Fort Amsterdam , later called\\nNieuw Amsterdam  (New Amsterdam), on present-day\\nManhattan Island.[45][46]\\nThe colony of New Amsterdam extended from the southern tip\\nof Manhattan to modern-day Wall Street , where a 12-foot\\n(3.7\\xa0 m) wooden stockade  was built in 1653  to protect agains t\\nNative American and English raids.[47] In 1626, the Dutch\\ncolonial Director-General Peter Minuit , as charged by the Dutch\\nWest India Company , purchased the island of Manhattan from\\nthe Canarsie , a small  Lenape band,[48] for \"the  value of 60\\nguilders \"[49] (about $900 in 2018).[50] A frequently told but\\ndisproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24\\nworth of glass beads.[51][52]\\nFollowing the purchase, New Amste rdam grew slowly.[24] To attract settlers, the Dutch institu ted the patroon\\nsystem  in 1628, whereb y wealthy Dutchmen (patroons , or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New\\nNetherland would be awarded land, local political autonomy, and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade.\\nThis program had little success.[53]\\nSince 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly  in New Netherland, on authority\\ngranted by the Dutch States General . In 1639–1640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West\\nIndia Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of\\nfood, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies ).[24][54]\\nIn 1647, Peter Stuyvesant  began his tenure as the last Director-General  of New Netherland.

Cycling is increas ingly popular in\\nNew York City; in 2022 there were approximately 61,200 people who\\ncommuted daily using a bicycle and 610,000 daily bike trips, with both\\nnumbers nearly doubling over the previous decade.[222] As of 2022 , New\\nYork City had 1,525 miles (2,454\\xa0 km) of bike lane s, includin g 644 miles\\n(1,036\\xa0km) of segregated or \"protected\" bike lanes citywide.[222]\\nStreets are also a defining feature of the city.

New York City has an extensive web\\nof freeways  and parkways , which link the city\\'s boroughs to each other and to\\nNorth Jersey , Westchester County, Long Island, and southwestern Connecticut\\nthrough bridges and tunnels . Because  these highways serve millions of outer\\nborough and suburban residents who commute  into Manhattan, it is common for\\nmotorists to be stranded for hours in traffic congestion  that are a daily\\noccurrence, particularly during rush hour .[574][575] Congestion pricing in New\\nYork City was approved in March 2024 and is expected to enter into force in mid-\\nJune if lawsuits will not overturn it.[576]\\nUnlike the rest of the United States , New York State prohibits right or left turns\\non red lights  at traffic signals in cities with a population greater than one million,\\nto reduce traffic collisions and increase pedestrian safety. In New York City,\\ntherefore, all turns on red lights are illegal unless a sign permitt ing such\\nmaneuvers is present.[577]\\nThe boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island are located on islands with the same names, while Queens and\\nBrooklyn are at the west end of the larger Long Island, and the Bronx is on New York State\\'s mainland.\\nManhattan Island  is linked to New York City\\'s outer boroughs and to New Jersey by an extensive network of\\nbridges and tunne ls.
