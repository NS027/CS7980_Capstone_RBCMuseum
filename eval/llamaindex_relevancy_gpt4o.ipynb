They said are not seeing anything threatening in his postings so far. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInvestigators also have accessed his cellphone, which was sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe FBI is leading the investigation, with assistance from the Secret Service and state and local agencies. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow is Trump now?\\\\n\\\\nThe Trump campaign said in a statement Saturday night that the former president was \\\\\\'fine.\" He was taken to a local hospital and left a few hours later.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn a post on Truth Social Saturday night, Trump described his injuries: \"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHe thanked the Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies for their rapid response, and extended condolences to the family of the man who was killed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHe posted on Truth Social early Sunday that Americans need to \"remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness.\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win,\" Trump wrote. \"I truly love our Country, and love you all, and look forward to speaking to our Great Nation this week from Wisconsin,\" where the Republican National Convention begins Monday.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVideo posted by a Trump aide to social media early Sunday morning showed him walking down the steps of his plane unaided after landing at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.   \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe following day, he made an appearance at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, with his right ear bandaged, and was greeted with rousing cheers from the crowd.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhere was the Trump rally and how far away was the shooter?\\\\n\\\\nThe rally was in Butler, Pennsylvania, which is north of Pittsburgh and is the county seat of Butler County.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe gunman was on the roof of a building, outside the rally\\\\\\'s security perimeter set up by the Secret Service, and opened fire from about 410 feet away from the stage where Trump was speaking, law enforcement sources said. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTwo law enforcement sources told CBS News that the shooter was spotted outside the security perimeter as people were filing into the rally, and he was reported by a bystander to the Butler County Sheriff\\\\\\'s Office. He was identified as a suspicious person by police, the sources said. Multiple attendees also said they saw the gunman and alerted officers shortly before the shooting.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAn armed municipal officer with Butler Township encountered the gunman before the shooting, Butler County Sheriff Michael Sloupe confirmed to CBS News. The officer and others had been previously alerted to a suspicious person and began searching for him right away, Sloupe told CBS Pittsburgh reporter Jen Borrasso.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAt some point, the officer was hoisted by another officer onto the roof of the building where the shooter was in position. The shooter focused his rifle towards the officer, who let go and fell off the roof. Then the shooter began firing into the crowd, according to Sloupe.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe gunman fired 6 to 8 rounds using a semiautomatic AR-style rifle from his position approximately 400 feet from the podium, before he was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper team.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRojek, with the FBI, called it \"surprising\" that the gunman was able to fire multiple shots. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"It is incredibly difficult to have a venue open to the public, and to secure that against any possible threat, against a very determined attacker,\" Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said of the Secret Service. \"That\\\\\\'s a huge lift to try and do it.\" \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWho was the victim who was fatally shot?\\\\n\\\\nThe spectator who was killed has been identified as Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old man who was shot while attempting to shield his family from the gunfire, Pennsylvania Gov.']</td>\n",

They said are not seeing anything threatening in his postings so far. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInvestigators also have accessed his cellphone, which was sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe FBI is leading the investigation, with assistance from the Secret Service and state and local agencies. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow is Trump now?\\\\n\\\\nThe Trump campaign said in a statement Saturday night that the former president was \\\\\\'fine.\" He was taken to a local hospital and left a few hours later.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn a post on Truth Social Saturday night, Trump described his injuries: \"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHe thanked the Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies for their rapid response, and extended condolences to the family of the man who was killed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHe posted on Truth Social early Sunday that Americans need to \"remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness.\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win,\" Trump wrote. \"I truly love our Country, and love you all, and look forward to speaking to our Great Nation this week from Wisconsin,\" where the Republican National Convention begins Monday.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVideo posted by a Trump aide to social media early Sunday morning showed him walking down the steps of his plane unaided after landing at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.   \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe following day, he made an appearance at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, with his right ear bandaged, and was greeted with rousing cheers from the crowd.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhere was the Trump rally and how far away was the shooter?\\\\n\\\\nThe rally was in Butler, Pennsylvania, which is north of Pittsburgh and is the county seat of Butler County.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe gunman was on the roof of a building, outside the rally\\\\\\'s security perimeter set up by the Secret Service, and opened fire from about 410 feet away from the stage where Trump was speaking, law enforcement sources said. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTwo law enforcement sources told CBS News that the shooter was spotted outside the security perimeter as people were filing into the rally, and he was reported by a bystander to the Butler County Sheriff\\\\\\'s Office. He was identified as a suspicious person by police, the sources said. Multiple attendees also said they saw the gunman and alerted officers shortly before the shooting.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAn armed municipal officer with Butler Township encountered the gunman before the shooting, Butler County Sheriff Michael Sloupe confirmed to CBS News. The officer and others had been previously alerted to a suspicious person and began searching for him right away, Sloupe told CBS Pittsburgh reporter Jen Borrasso.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAt some point, the officer was hoisted by another officer onto the roof of the building where the shooter was in position. The shooter focused his rifle towards the officer, who let go and fell off the roof. Then the shooter began firing into the crowd, according to Sloupe.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe gunman fired 6 to 8 rounds using a semiautomatic AR-style rifle from his position approximately 400 feet from the podium, before he was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper team.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRojek, with the FBI, called it \"surprising\" that the gunman was able to fire multiple shots. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"It is incredibly difficult to have a venue open to the public, and to secure that against any possible threat, against a very determined attacker,\" Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said of the Secret Service. \"That\\\\\\'s a huge lift to try and do it.\" \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWho was the victim who was fatally shot?\\\\n\\\\nThe spectator who was killed has been identified as Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old man who was shot while attempting to shield his family from the gunfire, Pennsylvania Gov.']</td>\n",
