He was identified as a suspicious person by police, the sources said. Multiple attendees also said they saw the gunman and alerted officers shortly before the shooting.\n\n\n\nAn armed municipal officer with Butler Township encountered the gunman before the shooting, Butler County Sheriff Michael Sloupe confirmed to CBS News. The officer and others had been previously alerted to a suspicious person and began searching for him right away, Sloupe told CBS Pittsburgh reporter Jen Borrasso.\n\n\n\nAt some point, the officer was hoisted by another officer onto the roof of the building where the shooter was in position. The shooter focused his rifle towards the officer, who let go and fell off the roof. Then the shooter began firing into the crowd, according to Sloupe.\n\n\n\nThe gunman fired 6 to 8 rounds using a semiautomatic AR-style rifle from his position approximately 400 feet from the podium, before he was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper team.\n\n\n\nRojek, with the FBI, called it ""surprising"" that the gunman was able to fire multiple shots. \n\n\n\n""It is incredibly difficult to have a venue open to the public, and to secure that against any possible threat, against a very determined attacker,"" Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said of the Secret Service. ""That\'s a huge lift to try and do it."" \n\n\n\nWho was the victim who was fatally shot?\n\nThe spectator who was killed has been identified as Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old man who was shot while attempting to shield his family from the gunfire, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said at a news conference Sunday.\n\n\n\n""Corey was the very best of us,"" Shapiro'
