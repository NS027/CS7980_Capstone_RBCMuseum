8,How did Crooks' COVID-consciousness show before the incident with the ex-President?,"['Koehler, had a somewhat different view, telling KDKA\'s Megan Schiller that Crooks was a loner who was bullied for his appearance and wore camo/hunting outfits in class. He said Crooks would often sit in the cafeteria alone before class. He also said Crooks was very COVID-conscious and wore a surgical mask long after they were required. \n\n\n\nBut Mark Sigafoos, who graduated with Crooks and had two classes with him senior year, said he never saw him bullied. He described Crooks as super smart and approachable, engaged in class and always volunteering answers. \n\n\n\n""This is one of the things that is being misconstrued — he was not some type of loner trenchcoat wearer. And I will say he was definitely nerdy, for sure, but he never gave off that he was creepy or like a school shooter,"" Sigafoos said. ""He seemed like he wouldn\'t hurt a fly.""\n\n\n\nCrooks\' political leanings were not immediately clear. He was registered as a Republican voter in Pennsylvania but Federal Election Commission records show he previously made a $15 donation to a Democratic-aligned group.\n\n\n\nThere was no indication that Crooks had a connection to any military branch, officials confirmed to CBS News. \n\n\n\nCrooks had a membership at a nearby gun club for at least a year. Bill Sellitto, the president of the Clairton Sportsmen\'s Club in Clairton, Pennsylvania, told CBS News that Crooks was a member.\n\n\n\nA law enforcement official said early Sunday that the Secret Service and the FBI are investigating the suspect\'s background and speaking with his family. The FBI has secured his home and federal law enforcement is searching his family\'s residence in suburban Pittsburgh, the law enforcement official said. His family is cooperating with investigators, an FBI official said.\n\n\n\nLaw enforcement sources told CBS News on Sunday that suspicious devices were found in the gunman\'s vehicle. The gunman also had with him a piece of commercially available equipment that appeared capable of initiating the devices. Bomb technicians called to the scene were involved in securing and investigating the devices.\n\n\n\nDo we know the motive for the assassination attempt?\n\nIn a news conference late Saturday night, Kevin Rojek, special agent in charge of the FBI Pittsburgh office, refused to speculate on a possible motive.\n\n\n\n""Right now, we\'re tracking down all leads, and doing all interviews, and tracking anything that'

I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.
