# Avador Project

The Avador Project is an innovative initiative aimed at creating AI-driven avatars that represent historical positions and act as digital concierges through the Royal BC Museum (RBCM) collections. By utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the responses of these avatars are grounded in vetted historical sources. The avatars can also be controlled and prompted to reflect historical tones and presentations.
