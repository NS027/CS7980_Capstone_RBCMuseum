# Avador Project

The Avador Project is an innovative initiative aimed at creating AI-driven avatars that represent historical positions and act as digital concierges through the Royal BC Museum (RBCM) collections. By utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the responses of these avatars are grounded in vetted historical sources. The avatars can also be controlled and prompted to reflect historical tones and presentations.

## Project Vision

The Avador project seeks to explore the potential of AI avatars to provide engaging in-person and remote experiences. The prototype was instantiated as a TV monitor (hence the name "Avador") hung on a door, where users interact with the avatar through a microphone and speaker. Gesture detection was incorporated via a depth camera in the initial prototype.

The AI avatars can enable users to:
- Explore museum collections through user-directed dialogues.
- Engage with history-driven responses that combine textual archives and museum collections.
- Interact with avatars representing specific historical figures, allowing users to observe how attitudes have shifted over time.

This project opens new opportunities for remote and in-person engagement with museum collections, especially for those who cannot physically visit the museum.

## Features
- **Historical Representation**: AI avatars will represent specific historical positions or figures, offering insights and reflections from the past.
- **Controlled Responses**: Through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the avatars only provide responses based on vetted historical source material.
- **Customizable Tone**: The tone and presentation of the avatar are controlled through careful prompting and the inclusion of specific historical sources.
- **Remote Interaction**: Avatars offer the potential to engage with remote audiences, including virtual museum tours and online events.
- **Gesture Detection**: In future implementations, gesture detection will allow users to interact physically with the avatars.

## Project Timeline

- **September**: Re-create the Avador prototype to test and develop interaction ideas.
- **October - November**: Conduct usability studies focusing on museum avatar interactions with remote participants and students.
- **December**: Showcase the final version of the project for the BC Museum.

## Funding Opportunity

The Avador Project is eligible for funding through [Digital Museums Canada (DMC)](https://www.digitalmuseums.ca/funding/digital-projects/), a program designed to support Canadian museums, heritage, cultural, or Indigenous organizations. The funding is focused on accessible online projects that tell a structured story for specific audiences.

### Key Criteria for Funding:
- **Digital Storytelling**: Projects must focus on storytelling with a tailored user experience for a specific target audience.
- **Bilingual Presentation**: Eligible projects must be available in both English and French and may include other languages.
- **Accessibility**: The project must meet digital accessibility standards, allowing users to access content globally without cost or special equipment.
- **Content**: The project's content should reinforce a narrative or theme, rather than merely serve as a searchable database.

## How to Get Involved

The Avador project is an ongoing exploration into the intersection of AI, history, and digital engagement. We are currently seeking collaboration with web development agencies, museum professionals, and AI researchers to bring this project to life.
